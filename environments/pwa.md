In addition to running Coder in a web browser, you can also run each application
as a progressive web application (PWA). Using Coder as a PWA offers you an
experience that is akin to a native application and offers improved performance.

## Requirements

To use Coder as a PWA, you must be using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

## Installing the PWA

1. Log into Coder and select your environment.
2. Under **Applications**, click on an application in order to launch it as a
   new window (or tab).
3. Follow your browser's instructions for installing the application as a PWA.

Please note that applications are currently installed on a per-environment basis.
