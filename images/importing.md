Coder imports images from [Docker Registries](../admin/registries/index.md).

To import, head to **Images > Import Image**.

Optionally, you can provide a **description** of the image (shown to all users)
and a **Source Repo URL** to point to the image's source.

Finally, you can specify the minimum amount of resources (cores, memory, and
disk space) the environment should have when using this image.
